1. Install terraform 
2. Install google cloud init
3. Test installations:

gcloud init
terraform


## Configuration File ##
This is where all resources to your project are being defined

## Remote State ##
Stores the state as an object in a configurable prefix in a given bucket on GCS. This backend also supports state locking

## Run the following commands to initiate and set the terraform remote state bucket ##
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

## Understanding Terraform init ##

You will use `terraform init` to initialize your working directory that contains your configuration files.
You can use init to bring any working directory up to speed on changes within your configuration.
By default, when running init, terraform assumes you already have configuration files in the currently directory.

## Understanding Terraform plan ##

`terraform plan` creates and shows you an execution plan for your infrastructure.
By default, terraform plan looks within your current directory for config files and state files to refresh.
Using terraform plan can allow you to see if your execution plan matches your expectations. You can do this without making any changes.
You should run this command before executing any real-world state or configuration changes. That way, you will know exactly what's going 
to happen before commiting.

## Understanding Terraform Apply ##
Using terraform apply, you are able to apply the changes to your infrastructure that is generated by the execution plan from terraform plan
By default, terraform apply checks your current directory and applies any changes from your configuration files.
You can also set a path to another configuration file if need be.

## Understanding Terraform output ##
The `terraform output` command extracts the value of an output variable from a state file
output can  be used to extract values of a terraform module as well
outputs are a way to tell Terraform what data is important. This data is outputted when apply is called and can be queried using the terraform output command

# Run terraform validate


# Terraform modules #

As your infrastructure in your configuration files grows, editing configuration files directly can cause problems
This is where we use terraform modules. Modules are packages of terraform configurations contained as a group.
When using modules you can use the terraform init command to download any modules that are used in the configuration files
