Create Explicit Dependency
Explicit dependencies are used to inform dependencies between resources that are not visible to Terraform. In this example, consider that you will run on your instance that expects to use a specific Cloud Storage bucket, but that dependency is configured inside the application code and thus not visible to Terraform. In that case, you can use depends_on to explicitly declare the dependency.

create exp.tf


Run the following command to preview the resources created.

terraform plan

If prompted, enter the details for the instance creation as shown below:

var.instance_name: myinstance

var.instance_zone: us-east1-b

Run the following command to view the order of resource creation.

terraform apply

If prompted, enter the details for the instance creation as shown below:

var.instance_name: myinstance

var.instance_zone: us-east1-b

Confirm the planned actions by typing yes.

Observe that due explicit dependency, the compute instance is created after the creation of the Cloud Storage Bucket.
