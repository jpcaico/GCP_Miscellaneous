Defining variables makes it easy to store and reuse values
You can save your network variables in a different Terraform file, making it both easier to read and edit
Terraform support three different types of format variables: string, list and map.

# Creating Firewalls and associated rules

Creating a firewall will control access to and from services within our network
The default VPC network will create firewall rules that are shown in the default rules
But a manually created network you can have complete control over the firewall rules from start

Basic Example:

```
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default" {

name = "test-firewall"
network = " google_compute_network.default.name
allow {
    protocol = "icmp"
}
allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports = ["80","8080","1000-2000"]
}

source_tags = ["web"]

}

```
